# TEAM ULTIMATE

## Criteria #1: (Weighting 20%) Evidence of collaboration and usage of the provided tools:

I reviewed the teams gitHub repo log.

I was looking for every team member to have made a contribution. I also looked for evidence of strong use of branches and releases to manage the project through completion. I also looked for evidence that Slack was used to help organize project work. Finally, I reviewed the contributions.md file for evidence of organizational ability and focus (that is, some indication of roles, and splitting of work across the team)

I see a good distribution of effort across the team. I also see use of branches (they were used, but there doesn't seem to be systematic approach... people just named them what they felt like. It's a first start, in the future, work on a method that more aligned with a project plan (releases, tasks, etc.)) Also, I see branches were used well, and merged back into master (one or two left hanging though).

Great use of slack, and (though I'm not sure it added much (but would have if there were a project plan)) use of Asana was a nice touch (I like seeing initiative like this)

Score: 19/20


## Criteria #2: (Weighting 20%) Evidence of knowledge about python coding style conventions, syntax, and organization using modules and packages:

I was looking for broad rich use of the Python language (using fully the concepts we covered in class). Your program was to be organized into a structure with at least 2 modules, and run by a central .py file called AmesWeather.py (see directory structure outlined above).

I see that you structured the program as asked.

Score 19/20


## Criteria #3: (Weighting 20%) Error Handling and Evidence of good Design Choices

I was looking for your to recognize and handle errors gracefully. Also, as with any "real world" programming requirements, I expected that some "filling in the blanks" would need to be made and thus reasonable design choices made... and I was looking for you to document such definitions and/or "design choices" in your user instructions.

Your program was one of the better ones in this area. As we saw on CC01, a bit of work was necessary, but your team was close the first time.

Score: 18/20


## Criteria #4: (weighting 30%) Quality of Program

The code works reasonable well in addressing the requirements given (but, as we saw in CC01, needed work). No extra functionality was added, but basic functionality was generally met (but with some problems with error handling)

Score 29/30


## Competitive Assessment: 0-10%

Relative to the other teams, I place your overall approach (considering all factors) to place you in 1st place, thus giving your a score of 10 out of ten on the competitive assessment scale (1st is 10, second 7.5,  third, 5.0, and the fourth 2.5).

WOW Factor: Possible 10 bonus points
No extra functionality, documentations, etc. therefore no bonus given.  

Total = 19+19+18+29+10=95
