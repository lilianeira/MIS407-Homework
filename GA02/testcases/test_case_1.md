For a help function we expect the following: I am CYBOT version I was programmed to be totally obsessed with bus stops and weather! You should ask me about CyRide... or weather!
For current weather we expect the following: Right now in Ames, it is (current temperature) F and (condition). Today we see a high of (high temp), F and a low of (low temp). If it is a above 90 degrees we will get a random hot message, and if it is below 15 degrees you will get a cold message
For a tomorrow's weather function we expect the following: Tomorrow in Ames, we will see a high of (high temp) F and a low of (low) F (condition). If it is above 90 degrees, random hot message, if it is below 15 degrees, random cold message.
