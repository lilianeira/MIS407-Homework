#Team Repository

This your teamâ€™s private repo. Only Prof. Smith and your fellow team members will be able to see, clone, and push content to this repository.

Your ream will use this repository for group assignments, team challenges, and final project. You can also use the repository for other team files that you wish to put under version control.

The directory structure (do not alter this!) is as follows:

GA01
GA02
GA03
GA04
TC01
TC02
TC03
TC04
Final_Project

Each of these directories have been initialized with a README.md file. You will edit this file, and the contents of the directory for each of your Group Assignments and Team Challenges.

If you wish, you can create other directories to store any other side projects/experiments the team would like to try - but DON'T ALTER THE EXISTING DIRECTORY NAMES OR LOCATIONS.
